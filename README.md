My project work spans across multiple domains of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. In the area of supervised learning, I implemented classification models to analyze and categorize datasets, applying algorithms to solve real-world prediction problems. On the unsupervised side, I worked with clustering methods to discover hidden structures and patterns in data, providing valuable insights without the need for labeled training examples. These projects strengthened my understanding of model building, evaluation, and data-driven decision-making.

In addition to data science tasks, I have completed major projects in Natural Language Processing (NLP). One of my significant works was the development of a detailed Urdu-to-English machine translation system, designed to bridge the gap between languages by enabling accurate text translation. This project required a deep understanding of linguistic structures, preprocessing techniques, and translation models.

Another core project was focused on sentiment analysis, where I designed a system capable of identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from textual data. This involved text preprocessing, feature extraction, and the use of machine learning models to classify sentiments effectively. Both NLP projects highlighted my ability to work with language-based data, address real-world communication challenges, and apply AI techniques to enhance human-computer interaction.

Together, these projects demonstrate my practical experience with supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as my strong foundation in NLP, showcasing my ability to design, implement, and optimize AI-driven solutions.
